		<p style="padding-left: 15px;padding-right: 10px;">
The Basilica of Bom Jesus (Portuguese: Basílica do Bom Jesus; Konkani: Borea Jezuchi Bajilika) is a Roman Catholic basilica located in Goa, India, and is part of the Churches and convents of Goa UNESCO World Heritage Site.[1][2] The basilica is located in Old Goa, former capital of Portuguese India, and holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier.[3]

'Bom Jesus' (literally, 'Good (or Holy) Jesus') is the name used for the Ecce Homo in the countries of Portuguese colonization. The Jesuit church is India's first minor basilica, and is considered to be one of the best examples of baroque architecture and Portuguese Colonial architecture in India. It is one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World.</p></div>

		<p style="padding-left: 15px;padding-right: 10px;">
The Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church (Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Imaculada Conceição) is located in Panjim, Goa, India. The Church conducts Mass every day in English, Konkani, and Portuguese.[1]

The colonial Portuguese Baroque style church was first built in 1541 as a chapel on a hill side overlooking the city of Panjim. It was eventually replaced by a larger church in the 1600s as part of Portuguese Goa's religious expansion.[2][3] This church houses the ancient bell that was removed from the Augustinian ruins of the Church of Our Lady of Grace (Nossa Senhora da Graça) in the once famed city of Old Goa. This bell is considered to be the second largest of its kind in Goa, surpassed only by the Golden Bell which resides in the Sé Cathedral in Old Goa.</p></div
