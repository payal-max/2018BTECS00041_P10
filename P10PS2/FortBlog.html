				<p style="padding-left: 15px;padding-right: 10px;">
The fort was constructed in 1612 to guard against the Dutch and the Marathas. It was a reference point for the vessels coming from Europe at that time. This old Portuguese fort stands on the beach south of Candolim, at the shore of the Mandovi River. It was initially tasked with defense of shipping and the nearby Bardez sub-district.

A freshwater spring within the fort provided water supply to the ships that used to stop by. This is how the fort got its name: Aguada, meaning watery in the Portuguese language. Crews of passing ships would often visit to replenish their freshwater stores. The Aguada Fort Lighthouse erected in 1864 is the oldest of its kind in Asia. Built in 1612, it was once the grandstand of 79 cannons. It has the capacity of storing 2,376,000 gallons of water, one of the biggest freshwater storage of the time in whole of Asia. This fort is divided in two segments: the upper part acted as fort and watering station, while the lower part served as a safe berth for Portuguese ships. Whereas the upper part has a moat, underground water storage chamber, gunpowder room, lighthouse, and bastions, it also has a secret escape passage to use during time of war and emergency. The lighthouse at the initial stage is used to emit light once in 7 minutes.

Fort Aguada was the most prized and crucial fort of Portuguese. The fort is so large that it envelops the entire peninsula at the southwestern tip of Bardez. Built on the mouth of Mandovi River, it was strategically located and was the chief defense of Portuguese against the Dutch and Marathas.

During the Salazar Administration, Fort Aguada was repurposed for use as a prison primarily, some claim, for Salazar's political opponents.[citation needed]</p></div>

				<p style="padding-left: 15px;padding-right: 10px;">
Sinquerim Fort is one of the biggest and inspiring forts conserved and is one of the famous landmarks of Goa's history. The fort is situated within a distance of 18 kilometre from Panaji. Created in the year 1613, Sinquerim Fort is an extension of Aguada Fort. The fame of the fort has augmented from the fact that its cliff on which it was created provides a delightful sight of military architects.The lighthouse that was created in Sinquerim Fort was regarded as one of the oldest lighthouses in entire Asia. To begin with, the lighthouse was used to release light once in 7 minutes. In the year 1834, the lighthouse was updated to release light and to make eclipse for every 30 seconds. In the course of thegovernment of Salazar, a Portuguese professor, Sinquerim Fort was reframed for the utilisation of prison. According to historical record, Sinquerim Fort prison was used for punishing Salazar's political enemies. Furthermore, number of convicts in the prison were found to be Western travellers who served for drug based misconducts. Though, in the year 1976, the fort was abandoned by Portuguese.</p>
